I'm creating a CV automation tool on Python. 

I want to create a streamlit application in the following format. 



I want to take the following information from the user. 

As I'm giving the Gitrepo for free, I use few API keys from few companies.

Groq Key : Each user will provide their groq free tier API key 



Utilising that, I need to call a python function in my backend functionality.



Groq Key feeding is a one time use key. So once the user enters the key, call a function to save a .env function and save that key. Give me the placeholder function, I'll take care of the rest.



The details needed from the user in the following format:

{
    "name" : "", 
    "email_id" : "", 
    "mobile" : "", 
    "linkedin_url" : "", 
    "github_url" : "",
    "city": "", 
    "country" :"", 
    "education" :[
        "education1" : {
            "course_name" : "", 
            "university_name" : "", 
            "start_year" : "", 
            "end_year" : "", 
            "Modules" : ["m1", 'm2'],
            "grade" : ""
        }, 
        "education2":{
            "course_name" : "", 
            "university_name" : "", 
            "start_year" : "", 
            "end_year" : "", 
            "modules" : ["M1", "m2", ],
            "grade" : ""
        }
    ], 
    "work_experience" : {
        "work_ex_1" : {
            "role_name":"", 
            "company" : "", 
            "country" : "", 
            "start_month" : "", 
            "start_year": "", 
            "end_month" : "", 
            "end_year" : "",
            "experience_points" :[
                "point1", 
                "point2" ,
            ]
        }
    }, 

    "skills_certifications" : {
        "skills" : ['skill1', ...],
        'databases' : [db1, db2, ],
        'cloud' : [...], 
        'certifications' : [
            "link" : "http...", 
            "certification_name " : ""
        ]
    }
    "awards_achievements" : [
        pt1, pt2, ....
    ]
}

Every user might want extra sub headings like Mentoring experience, other experience
For that create a custom add_heading button in the streamlit application and take input of headings, role_name, location, start_end_date similar to the work expereince field in the JSON 

Create a robust streamlit front-end for the above use case.
